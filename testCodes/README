Sapporo2, test and example programs

This folder contains a set of test and example programs that can
be used with Sapporo2. 

===============================================================================

BUILD

Set the correct paths to the CUDA toolkit / AMD SDK in the files:
Makefile and Makefile_ocl (the CUDA_TK variable)

To build the CUDA versions:
'make'

Tol build the OpenCL versions:
'make -f Makefile_ocl' 

In both cases make sure you build the matching sapporo library in the 'lib' folder.

Make sure that the GPU kernel sources and ptx files are in a subfolder 'CUDA' can be 
symlinked from the lib folder. This is done by default in the Makefiles.

===============================================================================

Programs:

test_gravity_block_* ,       tests the 4th order hermite version of the library (grape6 compatible)
test_gravity_block_g5_*,     tests the 2nd order version of the library (GRAPE5 compatible)
test_gravity_block_6th_*,    tests the 6th order hermite version of the library.
test_performance_rangeN* ,   tests the performance on integrating N particles. So computes N*N forces.
test_performance_blockStep*, tests the performance of the code when using different block-sizes in
a block-time step method.

USAGE / Examples

How to start a 4th order test using different precision:
CUDA, 4th order default
./test_gravity_block_cuda  
./test_gravity_block_cuda 16364 -> number of particles is 16384 using CUDA
./test_gravity_block_ocl  16364 -> number of particles is 16384 using OpenCL

./test_gravity_block_cuda 16364 CUDA/kernels4thDP.ptx 1 1  ->
  number of particles is 16384 using CUDA, using a full double precision kernel, with 
  integration order 1 (=FOURTH order) with precision 1 (=DOUBLE precision)
./test_gravity_block_ocl 16364 OpenCL/kernels4thDP.cl 1 1  ->
  same as above but now using OpenCL.

Test the N*N performance
./test_performance_rangeN_cuda -> compute time it takes to integrate forces and retrieve results for the default (=1024) number of particles

./test_performance_rangeN_cuda 131072 -> As above but now with 131072 particles
./test_performance_rangeN_ocl 131072  -> As above but now using OpenCL
./test_performance_rangeN_ocl 131072 OpenCL/kernels4thDP.cl 1 1 -> As above but now using full double precision

./test_performance_rangeN_6th_ocl 131072 -> 6th order, 131072 particles using OpenCL
